I intend to build Full Stack Apps and explain the philosohy around it using ground up tutorials on every topic & provide opportunities for Micro Learning along the way.

## Shorts Folder.

This folder has working examples of terraform functions. These is an example for each function ever addressed on my channel there in its specific folder.

### You can use that example to learn / explore more doing the following.

```
cd shorts/[relevant_folder_of_choice]
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

### Example Output of Max Function

```
srinivas@Srinivass-BigMac Tutorials % cd shorts/max
srinivas@Srinivass-BigMac max % terraform apply --auto-approve

Changes to Outputs:
  + max_val = 12

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform state, without changing any real infrastructure.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

max_val = 12
```
