This folder has working examples of terraform functions. These is an example for each function ever addressed on my channel there in its specific folder.

### You can use that example to learn / explore more doing the following.

```
cd shorts/[func_type]/[relevant_folder_of_choice]
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

#### Current Function Types Covered on the Channel
  - [Numeric Functions / num_func] ()
